                        <p>His favourite food is salt fish. He even can eat it only with that and rice. He said salt fish reminds him of his childhood life as his family was poor and didnt have anthing except salt fish, but that already enough. He dislike spicy and sour food such as asam pedas, tomyam, etc.</p>

                        <p>This amazing woman, is my mom, name Saridah binti Mokhtar. She born on 16th December 1980, at Sungai Pelek, Sepang, Selangor. She currently 43 years old.

                        <img src="img/my mom.jpeg" width="100%">
                        <p>My mom have five siblings and she was the youngest. Even though, she was the youngest child, she is very independet woman. She can cook at a very young age and love to try cook something new and often cook for her family. Hence, I really do love dish from her. Her cook is always the best!</p>
                        <p>Another interesting facts about my mom is she can speak javanese. Her grandmother and grandfather is originally from Jawa, Indonesia. Not just only her family, but also the villagers at Sungai Pelek, Sepang, Selangor, is mostly their great great grandma and grandpa from Jawa, Indonesia and can speak javanese well, except, nowadays, not many youngers can speak javanese much, only they are understand some words.</p>

                        <p>This is my 2nd sister, Masyitah binti Muhrif. She is currently 19 years old now and work as teacher at Cahaya Iman, at Batu 9 Cheras, Selangor, while waiting UPU results. She born on 5th July 2004 at Kajang, Selangor. From my perspective, she is the most clever among of us (siblings) as she got an excellent grades and actives in Co-curriculom since she was child. She even managed to studied at Sekolah Agam Menengah, Batu 10, Cheras (SAM10), which only can studied at that school after get an official letter from Jabatan Agama Islam Selangor (JAIS). Hence, probably many people admire their older sister, but for me, I'm admire her. </p>
                        <p>Another unique about her is she loves to bake and every baking she make, is work and taste delicious. She able to bake cookies, cake, kuih raya, etc. I believe she can able to make a living even with her talent. Other than that, she loves to listen music, taking picture, and watch drama. </p>
